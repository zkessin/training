= HTML5 For Application Developers (5 Days)

The modern web is dynamic and amazing. As web developers we can build
applications in a browser or on a smartphone that only a few short
years ago would have required a desktop application that was written
in C++ or the like. Now many of those applications can be build (and
have been) in the browser with the tools of the web including
Javascript and CSS. 

We will look at the elements of the modern web including LocalStroage,
Filesystem access, WebSockets, WebWorkers and so on. 

In addition this class will feature a day on phonegap showing how to
build cross platform applications based on web technologies.
