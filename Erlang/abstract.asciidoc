= Introduction To Erlang

In the 1980's Ericson had a problem. They need to program Telephone
switches to be highly available, scalable and able to be upgraded
without disrupting ongoing service. They evaluated every language they
could find before eventually designing their own language... Erlang. 

The requirements of telephone switches in the 1980's are very much
like the requirements of web applications in the current decade, we
want our application services to run 24/7.

Erlang and the OTP framework provide one of the most robust platforms
for building applications that can scale. While Java nd C# are built
around objects Erlang is built around processes. Unlike OS processes
or threads Erlang process are very light weight around 1K each. 

Erlang is the platform behind CouchDB, Riak, RabbitMQ, EJabberd
