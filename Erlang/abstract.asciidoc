= Introduction To Erlang
 

The requirements of telephone switches in the 1980's are very much
like the requirements of web applications, hence the interest in
Erlang for the modern application developer.


Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft
real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its
uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and
instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for
concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

OTP is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing
middle-ware to develop these systems. It includes its own distributed
database, applications to interface towards other languages, debugging
and release handling tools.

This class will introduce Erlang and OTP to the student. At the end of
the class students will have a solid understanding of how to structure
an application in Erlang and the knowledge of how to build it.
