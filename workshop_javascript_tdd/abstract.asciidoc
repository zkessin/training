== Javascript TDD and Pair Programming workshop (1 Day)

TDD and Pair Programming are key elements of many agile
methods. However this is a skill that needs to be practiced. 

This is a one day workshop designed to introduce programmers to Pair
Programming and TDD in Javascript. Bring your laptop and get ready to
write code as this workshop will feature not much lecture and a lot of
lab. 

We will explore the ideas of TDD, along with Testing frameworks QUnit
and Jasmine. Once we explore the ideas of testing we will pair off and
use the Cloud 9 IDE to write code. 

NOTE: Class assumes that students know JavaScript and the basics of
git. Students should have accounts on cloud 9 and github.

Class will be given in English
