* Spun off from Document Cloud Project
* Key dependency of backbone.js
* Current Version 1.4.2

== Underscore.js the basics:

* Consistent Functional Interface
* Operations are pure functions
* Allows for Chaining of operations
* Works in the browser and in node.js
* Easy to create Mixins
* Ports to Lua, PHP, Objective-C, Perl and Coldfusion


== General List/Collection  functions

* Functions take a list or collection 
* Function return a *new* list 


== Map
* Takes a list and a function returns a new list

* _.join() - Joins string together with a glue string
* _.isBlank("String") - True if sting matches /^\s*$/

== Developing an Function Library
* Keep functions Short (< 5 lines each)
* Use pure (or mostly pure) functions
* Practice TDD
* Namespace functions
* Use Generators

== Function Library Examples

== Functions as Algebra
* Use simple functions
* focus on the what not the how
