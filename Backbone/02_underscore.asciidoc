== Underscore.js the basics:

* Consistent Functional Interface
* Pure functions only 
* Allows for Chaining of operations 


== General list functions
* map()
* filter() /reject()
* reduce()
* pluck()
* groupBy

== Map
* Takes a list and a function returns a new list

* _.join() - Joins string together with a glue string
* _.isBlank("String") - True if sting matches /^\s*$/ 
* _.startsWith(), _.endsWidth()

== Developing an Function Library
* Use pure (or mostly pure) functions
* Practice TDD 
* Namespace 

TODO: Examples

== Functions as Algebra 
* Use simple functions
* focus on the what not the how
