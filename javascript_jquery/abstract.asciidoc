==  jQuery Novice to Master

The web has gone from a simple platform for displaying HTML to a
rich platform for building interactive applications. But There is a
learning curve. To move from developing a desktop application to a web
application requires that the developer to learn a new language and
new APIs. 

The class will start by introducing the Javascript language, then
precede to introduce the browser as a virtualized environment in day
two. In the final two days we will go over jQuery and how to structure
applications in the browser. 

Building in Browser applications can be difficult, "You are in a
maze of twisty little browsers, none alike". Trying to figure out how
to do something so that it works correctly on Chrome, Firefox and
Internet Explorer can be an exercise in frustration.

In addition the DOM API is inconsistent and painful. In fact every
method in the DOM has a major but in at least one version of a major
browser. 

Thankfully John Resig created jQuery a well tested multi browser
framework that provides a very nice functional abstraction layer on
top of the DOM and other browser APIs.

This class will aim to take someone who has never used jQuery before
and enable show them how to select elements from the page, manipulate
those elements, add and remove elements from the page and more. In
addition jQuery's interfaces for performing Ajax operations will be
covered along with jQuery's plugin interface. 

The class will features lectures and extensive workshops. Basic
knowledge of JavaScript is needed.
