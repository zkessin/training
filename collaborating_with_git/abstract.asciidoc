== Building Collaborations with Git and Github 

Software like so many other things is about collaboration, and good
collaboration needs good tools. In fact Joel Spolsky in his famous
"Joel Test" puts +Do you have source control+ as the first item. 

The current best of type source code control system is git, which was
created by Linus Torvolds to manage the linux kernel project. Git has
a reputation for being complex but the truth is that the parts of git
that are actually required for managing a project are pretty simple. 

We will show how to use git from the Bash command line, Emacs,
Eclipse, and the Mac and Windows. 

In addition we will focus on github as a tool for collaborations. The
class will show the various major features of github as they relate to
how people can collaborate on different projects.
