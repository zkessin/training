= Functional Programming with CoffeeScript and JQuery and Underscore (2 days)

When Brendan Eich created the language that we now call JavaScript he
based it on two other languages Scheme and Smalltalk. From Scheme
JavaScript inherits first class functions, and it is no surprise that
JavaScript can act a very nice functional language.

When you add CoffeeScript, jQuery and underscore.js to the mix it
becomes even more powerful to use functional abstractions to build
programs in the browser environments. 

By chaining a number of small simple operations it is possible to
build up an algebra of functions and operators which enable the
developer to build a lot of power very quickly.
 

NOTE: Class assumes some familiarity with JavaScript and web
development. Prior experience with functional programming is useful
but not necessary.
